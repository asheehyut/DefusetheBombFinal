## **AGENT 201 BRIEFING**
You are an operative of the CIA tasked with uncovering the identity of the greatest leader of the most powerful Mexican Drug Cartel. Intel has confirmed that the leader intends to eliminate his rivals with a bomb set to detonate on **December 6, 2024**, in the famed Mexican Casino "Gourd Cards."  
Your mission: **defuse the bomb** and uncover the cartel leader's identity before it's too late.  

**WARNING:** Any misstep could result in catastrophe. Follow the steps below with precision.  

---

## **STEP 0: BLEND IN**  
Spend time in the casino. Play games, interact casually, and ensure you look like an ordinary player. Avoid drawing attention to yourself. Trust no one.  

---

## **STEP 1: LOCATE THE BOMB**  
Discreetly navigate to the **Secret Storage** room where the bomb is hidden. Avoid surveillance and security patrols.  

---

## **STEP 2: DECRYPT THE SERIAL NUMBER**  
On the bomb interface, locate the **Serial Number.** It will follow the format:  
`x00xx1xx0`  

- `x`: Random letters  
- `0`: Random numbers  
- `1`: **Secret key for toggles**  

### **Your Task:**  
1. Extract the **secret key (1)** from the serial number.  
2. Convert this key into **binary format.**  
3. Use the binary key to unlock the **Toggle System.**

---

## **STEP 3: DEFUSE THE WIRES**  
Once toggles are defused, proceed to the **Wire Defusal System.**  

### **Your Task:**  
1. Identify and disconnect wires at **indexes 0 and 2** (count starts from the top).  
2. If successful, the interface will transform to resemble the toggles system. Use the same approach to ensure wires are inactive.  

---

## **STEP 4: ENTER THE DS CODE**  
After defusing the wires, the **Action Button** becomes active. Press it to access the **Keypad Interface.**  

To proceed, input the **DS Code** by answering one of the following questions. (Answers are case-insensitive.)  

1. **What is the name of a specific sequence of tasks which leads to a specific result in programming?**  
2. **Every computer uses b____ code.**  
3. **What is an alternative to loops in programming?**  
4. **Each "block" in a b_____ contains data, and blocks are linked in a chronological "chain."**  
5. **This technique determines an index or location for the storage of an item in a data structure.**

---

## **STEP 5: SEND NAME TO THE CIA**  
Once the bomb is defused and the name of the Cartel Leader is revealed, immediately transmit the name to headquarters via your **secure CIA channel.** Use the encryption protocol to ensure confidentiality.  

---

## **MISSION NOTES:**  
- Every step must be executed carefully.  
- **Failure is not an option.** Lives depend on your success.  
- Stay vigilant and remain undetected.

**Good luck, Agent 201.**
